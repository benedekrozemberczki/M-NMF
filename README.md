### Abstract
<p align="justify">
Network embedding, aiming to learn the low-dimensional representations of nodes in networks, is of paramount importance in many real applications. One basic requirement of network embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks. While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximities of nodes, the mesoscopic community structure, which is one of the most prominent feature of networks, is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure, and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework, which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures. We also provide efficient updating rules to infer the parameters of our model, together with the correctness and convergence guarantees. Extensive experimental results on a variety of real-world networks show the superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.

The model is now also available in the package [Karate Club](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/karateclub).

This repository provides a **TensorFlow** implementation for **M-NMF** as it is described in:

A reference MatLab implementation is available [[here]](https://github.com/AnryYang/M-NMF).

### Requirements

The codebase is implemented in Python 3.5.2. Package versions used for development are just below.
```
networkx          2.4
tqdm              4.19.5
numpy             1.13.3
pandas            0.20.3
tensorflow-gpu    1.12.0
jsonschema        2.6.0
texttable         1.2.1
python-louvain    0.11
```

### Datasets
<p align="justify">
The code takes an input graph in a csv file. Every row indicates an edge between two nodes separated by a comma. The first row is a header. Nodes should be indexed starting with 0. A sample graph for the `Facebook Politicians` dataset is included in the  `data/` directory.
</p>
### Logging
<p align="justify">
The models are defined in a way that parameter settings and cluster quality is logged in every single epoch. Specifically we log the followings:
</p>
```
1. Hyperparameter settings.     We save each hyperparameter used in the experiment.
2. Cluster quality.             Measured by modularity. We calculate it in every epoch.
3. Runtime.                     We measure the time needed for optimization -- measured by seconds.
```

### Options

Learning of the embedding is handled by the `src/main.py` script which provides the following command line arguments.
